			<h3>The Podcast Standards Project (PSP) was established in 2022 to protect the open nature of podcasting enabled by decentralized RSS distribution.</h3>
			<p>We’re a consortium of independent, prominent players in the podcast space. Without PSP and the support of its allies, we risk podcasting becoming a closed environment controlled by a handful of dominant players with competing priorities and proprietary visions of the future.</p>

				<h4>PSP Baseline Proposal</h4>
				<p>The Podcasting 2.0 initiative has established the "podcast" namespace through an open-source, community-driven project. Our goal is to establish this as the definitive namespace for podcasting and standardize a sub-set of tags that all podcast hosting providers and listening apps can uniformly support.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Building podcast technology that does not uniformly support core podcast standards fractures the open nature of podcasting and harms creators, listeners, and businesses operating in the space.

			We understand that podcasting is evolving quickly and there are advantages to innovation. However, basic support of existing standards has been sacrificed in the name of such innovation, needlessly fragmenting podcasting and hurting independent creators and developers.

			We share in the responsibility for this fragmentation by not clearly establishing a set of standards and encouraging all players in the industry to follow. This project aims to correct that wrong and ensure simple, open access to podcasting for all.</p>
		</section>

				<h3>The Details</h3>
				<p>When we speak about "standards" for podcasting, we mean:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>RSS as the primary and default syndication format</li>
					<li>RSS documents follow the 2.0 specification</li>
					<li>Podcast feeds declare the "podcast" namespace as their primary extension</li>
					<li>Implementation of the "podcast" namespace standard tags (sub-set)</li>
					<li>Feed providers utilize Podping as the primary notification method for feed changes</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>These standards were created by the Podcasting 2.0 initiative and adopted by the Podcast Standards Project with the intention of balancing the needs of podcasters for a sophisticated set of publishing features against the desire to make podcasting accessible to the largest possible number of listening applications and environments.</p>
